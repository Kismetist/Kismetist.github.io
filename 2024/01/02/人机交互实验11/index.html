<p>It is proposed to design an application that provides a platform to address daily life safety issues that students may encounter on campus. The application will collect data to investigate common safety issues on campus and gather students’ opinions on safety matters. Based on the collected data, a platform handling framework will be designed to facilitate the reporting and handling of issues by students after the platform is implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Website:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Critique Feedback:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Overall statement:</strong></p>
<p>The proposed application aimed at addressing students’ everyday safety concerns on campus and collecting data to investigate common safety issues is a commendable initiative. It has the potential to create a platform that facilitates reporting and handling of safety incidents. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the effectiveness and usability of the application.</p>
<p><strong>2. Identified problems in a category:</strong></p>
<p>a) Data collection: The process of collecting data on common safety issues may face challenges. It is essential to ensure that the data collected is comprehensive, accurate, and representative of the actual safety concerns on campus. Additionally, privacy concerns and data protection should be addressed to gain the trust of the student community.</p>
<p>b) Reporting mechanism: The ease and convenience of reporting incidents should be a priority. If the reporting process is complex or time-consuming, students may be discouraged from reporting incidents promptly. It is crucial to design a user-friendly interface that simplifies the reporting process and encourages students to provide detailed and accurate information.</p>
<p>c) Communication and response: It is important to establish effective channels of communication between students and the platform administrators. Prompt and appropriate responses to reported safety issues will contribute to building trust and ensuring that students feel their concerns are being addressed. Clear communication channels and timely updates on the progress of issue resolution should be incorporated into the platform.</p>
<p><strong>3. Solutions to each problem:</strong></p>
<p>a) Data collection: Implement a comprehensive survey or feedback mechanism that covers a wide range of safety concerns. Encourage students to provide feedback anonymously if they prefer, while ensuring the privacy and security of their data. Regularly analyze and evaluate the collected data to identify trends and prioritize the most pressing safety issues.</p>
<p>b) Reporting mechanism: Simplify the reporting process by creating an intuitive user interface. Provide clear instructions and categories for reporting different types of incidents. Allow students to attach relevant media (e.g., photos, videos) to provide additional context. Consider integrating geolocation features to automatically capture incident locations accurately.</p>
<p>c) Communication and response: Establish a streamlined communication system that notifies students about the progress and resolution of reported issues. Implement automated acknowledgments upon receiving a report to assure students that their concerns have been noted. Assign dedicated staff or volunteers to handle reported incidents promptly and provide regular updates to students on the actions taken.</p>
<p><strong>4. Expected improvement:</strong></p>
<p>By implementing the suggested solutions, the proposed application can expect several improvements. Firstly, it will be able to collect more comprehensive and accurate data on common safety issues, enabling a better understanding of the campus safety landscape. Secondly, the simplified reporting mechanism will encourage more students to report incidents, resulting in a more complete picture of safety concerns. Lastly, the improved communication and response system will enhance transparency and trust among students, fostering a safer campus environment.</p>
<p>Overall, with careful consideration of the identified problems and the implementation of the suggested solutions, the application has the potential to significantly contribute to addressing and resolving students’ everyday safety concerns on campus.</p>
